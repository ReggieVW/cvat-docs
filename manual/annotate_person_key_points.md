# Automatic annotation with person key points

See page [automatic_annotations](https://github.com/ReggieVW/cvat-docs/blob/main/manual/automatic_annotations.md#automatic-annotation-person-body-key-points).


# Manual annotation with person key points
<b>Note: This can only be executed after task [automatic annotation person key points](#automatic-annotation-with-person-key-points) is executed.</b>

You can drag a point and change the position of individual points. Move the points to the desired position. 

## Shape grouping
Pre-annotated points are automatically grouped â€” all points with the same colour are linked to a certain person.

## Swith on/off the keyframe
You can switch off the keyframe so intermediate frames will be drawn automatically. Interpolation will be used.

Interpolation can be used when there are key-points of two persons that intermingle for a few frames and manually correction is to cumbersome.

# Export person key points
<b>Note: the feature of directly exporting person key points with JSON is not available in CVAT. The JSON file also does not export the group_id which is necessary to group the person keypoints.</b>

First click on save because CVAT does not automatically saves the changes. Then click "Menu" in CVAT. Click "Export task dataset" and choose "CVAT for video".

Convert the CVAT XML into JSON. Further information about the conversion tool and installation https://github.com/ReggieVW/cvat-utils

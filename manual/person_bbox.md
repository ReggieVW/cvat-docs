### Track mode (basics)
Usage examples:

-   You need to select a ``Rectangle`` on the sidebar,
    in the appearing form, select the desired ``Label`` and the ``Drawing method``.

-   Creating a track for an object:
    - Create a ``Rectangle`` in ``Track mode`` by clicking on ``Track``.

    - In ``Track mode`` the rectangle will be automatically interpolated on the next frames. 
    - If the object starts to change its position, you need to modify the rectangle where it happens.
      <b>It isn't necessary to change the rectangle on each frame</b>, simply update several keyframes
      and the frames between them will be interpolated automatically.

-   When the annotated object disappears or becomes too small, you need to
    finish the track. You have to choose ``Outside Property``, shortcut ``O``.

-   If the object isn't visible on a couple of frames and then appears again,
    you can use the ``Merge`` feature to merge several individual tracks
    into one.

Remark: This task can only be executed after task [automatic annotation person body keypoints](https://github.com/ReggieVW/cvat-docs/blob/main/manual/automatic_annotations.md#automatic-annotation-person-body-keypoints) is executed.

## Annotation with points
You can drag a point and change the position of individual points. Move the point to the desired position, this way you will create a keyframe. You can hide it using the Outside, move around, etc. When the annotated object disappears, you have to choose Outside Property (see picture below)

## Shape grouping
Points are automatically grouped â€” all points with the same colour are linked to a certain person.

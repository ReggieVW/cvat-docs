# Automatic annotation with person body keypoints

See page [automatic_annotations](https://github.com/ReggieVW/cvat-docs/blob/main/manual/automatic_annotations.md#automatic-annotation-person-body-keypoints).

The result of an automatic annotation is an annotation with bounding boxes and body keypoints.

# Manual annotation with points
Remark: This can only be executed after task [automatic annotation person body keypoints](#automatic-annotation-with-person-body-keypoints) is executed.

You can drag a point and change the position of individual points. Move the point to the desired position, this way you will create a keyframe.

## Outside Property
When the annotated object disappears, you have to choose Outside Property (see picture below)

## Shape grouping
Points are automatically grouped â€” all points with the same colour are linked to a certain person.

## Swith on/off the keyframe
You can switch of the keyframe so intermediate frames will be drawn automatically. Interpolation will be used.
